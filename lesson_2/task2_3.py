# Using python as a calculator.
# Make a program with 2 numbers saved in separate
# variables a and b, then print the result for each of the following:
a = 12
b = 44
print(a + b)    # Addition
print(a - b)    # Subtraction
print(a / b)    # Division
print(a * b)    # Multiplication
print(a % b)    # Modulus
print(a ** b)   # Exponent (Power)
print(a // b)   # Floor division
